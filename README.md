# Codex Zeitgeist

â€¦ is a curated crash-report collection for Minecraft, modded or not. 

The objective of this project can also be explained as "curated crash-report collection":

  - Curated: for each documented crash report, we provide five "columns":
    1. Symptom
    2. Direct cause
    3. Technical Analysis
    4. Solution
    5. Remarks
  - Crash report: our primary target is crashes; whether to include non-crashing issues or not will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
  - Collection: this is the reason of this project being a git repo. 


More information are incoming.
